## Carry Through:

 The web application named 'Sahibinden' is a platform I've created using Django. This platform enables users to engage in
 buying and selling activities in various categories such as second-hand items, real estate, vehicles, and more.
 Potential buyers can browse through the available second-hand products and view them.
